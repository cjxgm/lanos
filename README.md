## Introduction
Lanos is a 32-bit not-so-protected non-UNIX-like OS. Useful functions
will be implemented as earliest as possible. Lanos will provide
LanosGL (there's OpenGL maybe), digital audio, high resolution,
single process with multi-threads, etc.

Lanos is a toy for hackers. It can be used for bootable demoscene.
